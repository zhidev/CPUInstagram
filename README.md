# Project 6 - Instapost

**Name of your app** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: 17 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [x] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [ ] User Profiles:
   - [x] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [x] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Cells background are in order of UIColor.blackColor(), UIColor.purpleColor(), UIColor.blueColor(), UIColor.redColor(), UIColor.grayColor() alternating
- [x] Automatically goes to tab controller after posting image, and automatically reloads table
- [x] User can't take photo when camera is unavailable
- [x] Pull to refresh though i think unnecesary for this app


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. The profile would've been much easier to implement if it was worked around from the very beggining. Trying to incorporate in created a lot of headaches.
2. 

Extras:
Models built to be extended.
